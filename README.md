### Set up & Daily

#### Local Env
- Open GitBash, navigate to - `cd ~shiva/MLZoomCamp`
- (One Time) Set up venv - `~shiva/anaconda3/python -m venv ./venv_mlzc`
- Activate venv - `source ./venv_mlzc/Scripts/activate`


### Week 1 - Introduction to ML
- https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/01-intro 
- Come up with a model to make a prediction - g(X) ~ y

#### Supervised Learning - Showing model different items and teach expected result (target variable) for each of the item
- Regression - If the prediction output is a number, e.g. cost of car, house etc
- Classification - If the prediction output is one of many classes/types, e.g. spam or not, what is image - car, cat, dog etc
  - Binary classification is when output is one of two types - e.g. spam or not
- Ranking - Score items 0 - 1 for all the list of provided, e.g. on an ecommerce site, rank items to display

#### CRISP-DM - Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining
CRISP-DM, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is an industry-proven way to guide your data mining efforts. As a methodology, it includes descriptions of the typical phases of a project, the tasks involved with each phase, and an explanation of the relationships between these tasks.
